Aweber (www.aweber.com) is an email marketing software that offers service to help businesses communicate more effectively with prospects and current customers. The Aweber Plugin by ContactUs.com is designed to help them use their websites to more grow their Aweber newsletter list through an Aweber newsletter signup form designed by ContactUs.com’s web conversion experts. 

Our plugin serves the Aweber newsletter form via one of two methods: (1) a newsletter tab callout placed on the page margins of your website, which will then open up a lightbox newsletter signup form (our recommended method, or (2) a newsletter signup form embedded directly onto your website’s page. The implementation of ContactUs.com’s HTML code is done entirely through the WordPress plugin. You start the implementation process by downloading and installing this plugin to your website’s WordPress admin account. Once installed, then you will create a ContactUs.com account within the plugin, add your Aweber account credentials, and then customize your signup form for your website. You will have some basic customizations available from within the plugin, and many additional customization options from within your ContactUs.com account (accessible from http://www.contactus.com).

Available templates are eye catching and can be strategically positioned in a non-intrusive way so your web visitors can feel invited to subscribe to your newsletter list instead of feeling forced to do it.

The plugin achieves this by offering more proactive form placements and using better-designed form templates.
